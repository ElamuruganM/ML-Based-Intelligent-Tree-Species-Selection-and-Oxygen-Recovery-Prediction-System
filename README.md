# ML-Based-Intelligent-Tree-Species-Selection-and-Oxygen-Recovery-Prediction-System
A machine learning–based web app predicts oxygen recovery and validates user feedback using a Logistic Regression–inspired model. It filters unreliable inputs with an adaptive acceptance range that self-calibrates over time, improving data quality, prediction accuracy, and environmental decision-making.
